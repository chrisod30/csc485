a. There are 8 distinct trees.
b. The addition of NP -> NP PP | Det N causes continuous loop of a non-terminal pointing to a non-terminal. As such it causes an infinite recursion. By switching it such that NP -> Det N | NP PP it appears to solve the problem as by ending the NP-loop when the parser finds a noun preceded by a determiner. Indeed this works well for the given example of "my dog saw a man in the park". However, this does not work in the general case as you cannot guarantee that a noun will always have a determiner in front. As such, you cannot guarantee that it won't reach NP -> NP PP. An example using the base vocabulary of the rdparser would be the sentence “Dogs ate man”.
